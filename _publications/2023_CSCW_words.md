abstract: "<p>
My toolbox of feminist wonder has been built from the threads of Karen Barad's theory of entanglements. Entanglement theory is an ethic-onto-epistemology that focuses on how the specific histories and materialities of phenomena are embedded in the acts of knowledge creation; thus matter and meaning are inseparable. I share my experience of applying different aspects of entanglement theory to multiple visualization research projects to demonstrate how theory, metaphors, and methods have been joy-ful and generative in my work.

**Workshop Description:** This one-day hybrid workshop builds on previous feminist CSCW workshops to explore feminist theoretical and methodological approaches that have provided us with useful tools to see things differently and make space for change. Since its inception over a decade ago, feminist HCI has progressed from the margins to mainstream HCI, with numerous references in the literature. Feminist HCI has also evolved to incorporate other critical HCI practices such as Queer HCI, participatory design, and speculative design. While feminist approaches have grown in popularity and become mainstream, it is getting more difficult to distinguish the feminist emancipatory core from other attempts of developing and improving society in various ways. In this workshop, we therefore want to revisit our feminist roots, where theory is a liberatory and creative practice, motivated by affect, curiosity, and wonder. We will engage in speculative, playful and collaborative making. From this standpoint, we consider which of our feminist tools can make a significant difference today, in a highly datafied world. The goal of this workshop is to; 1) create an inventory of feminist theories and concepts that have had an impact on our work as designers, educators, researchers, and activists; 2) develop a feminist toolbox for the CSCW community to strengthen our feminist literacy.
