Our work blends design, visualization, sound, and physical–digital experiences, guided by critical, feminist, and interdisciplinary perspectives. Through collaborations with museums, research labs, non-profits, and industry, we investigate how digital tools shape everyday life and imagine new possibilities for more ethical and inclusive technologies. 

📍 Based at the Department of Science & Technology, Linköping University, at the Visualization Center C in Norrköping, Sweden.
